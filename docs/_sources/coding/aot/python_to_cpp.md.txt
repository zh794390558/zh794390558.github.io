  Pythran is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language, with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python module annotated with a few interface description and turns it into a native Python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.

  It is meant to efficiently compile **scientific programs**, and takes advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units.
