- **robust:** FastSpeech avoids the issues of error propagation and wrong attention alignments, and thus nearly eliminates word skipping and repeating.
- **controllable:** FastSpeech can adjust the voice speed smoothly and control the word break.
- **high quality:** FastSpeech achieves comparable voice quality to previous autoregressive models (such as Tacotron 2 and Transformer TTS).
