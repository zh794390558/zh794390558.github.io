# Named-Entity Recognition

This system is **named entity recognition (NER)** which is probably the first step towards information extraction that attempts to identify and classify named entities in the text such as names, locations, things, organizations, times of people in predefined categories. Price, monetary value, percentage, product etc.

**What is Named Entities and Named Entity Recognition?**

Named-entity recognition (NER) is the method or system of extracting information which allows us to properly understand the subject or topic of the raw text. It is a process of automatically identifying the named entities present in a given text of any documents and classifying them into predefined categories such as ‘person’, ‘organization’, ‘location’ and so on.

The goal of a **named entity recognition** (NER) system is to identify all textual mentions of the named entities and also classify them. It helps to solve many real world problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP). NER is also simply known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction.
