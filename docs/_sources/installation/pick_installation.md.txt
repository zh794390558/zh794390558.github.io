# Pick a installation way for yourself

## Multiple installation ways

Currently we support multiple ways to install `DELTA`. Please choose one
installation for yourself according to your usage and needs.

## Install by pip

For the **quick demo of the features** and **pure NLP users**, you can
install the `nlp` version of `DELTA` by pip with a simple command:

```bash
pip install delta-nlp
```

Check here for
[the tutorial for usage of delta-nlp](../tutorials/training/text_class_pip_example.html).

**Requirements**: You need `tensorflow==2.0.0` and `python==3.6` in
MacOS or Linux.

## Install from the source code

For users who need **whole function of delta** (including speech and
nlp), you can clone our repository and install from the source code.

Please follow the steps here:
[Install from the source code](install_from_source.html)

## Use docker

For users who are **capable of use docker**, you can pull our images
directly. This maybe the best choice for docker users.
