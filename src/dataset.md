### TTS

### **中文语料库**

目前网络上尚未有免费的语料库，需要自行构建语料库或者是购买公司或者大学的语料库。对于自行构建语料库来说，除了韵律部分需要人工标记之外，其他部分实际上可以通过工具实现标注，例如字音转换，分词，词性标注，音素发音时长。

### ST

* [Must-C](https://ict.fbk.eu/must-c/)

  MuST-C is a multilingual speech translation corpus whose size and quality facilitates the training of end-to-end systems for speech translation from English into several languages. For each target language, MuST-C comprises several hundred hours of audio recordings from English [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks), which are automatically aligned at the sentence level with their manual transcriptions and translations.
