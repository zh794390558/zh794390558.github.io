# NLP Evoloution

## **What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?**

**As per Wikipedia:**

**Natural Language Processing** (**NLP**) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language (text and speech) data.

Before diving deeper into NLP, Let’s understand how communication happens in the human language and how NLP originated?

## **Let’s check out how NLP works and the major evolution in NLP....**

**Levels of NLP:** NLP includes a wide set of syntax, semantics, discourse, and speech tasks. The following chart broadly shows these points.

Don’t get confused by these new terms such as Phonology, Pragmatics, Morphology, Syntax, and Semantics. Let’s explore these in a very brief manner -

**Phonology** — This science helps to deal with patterns present in the sound and speeches related to the sound as a physical entity. It’s the smallest unit of sound in a language.

**Morphology** — This science deals with the structure of the words and the systematic relations between them. It’s the smallest unit of meaning in language.

**Syntax** — This science deals with the structure of the sentences where we know how words and sentences are constructed from these two building blocks.

**Semantics** — This science deals with the literal meaning of the words, phrases as well as sentences.

**Discourse** — Semantics in context. Conversation, persuasive writing, etc.

## **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** **Text** Vs **Speech**

Natural Language can refer to Text or Speech. Goal of both is the same: translate raw data (text or speech) into underlying concepts (NLU) then possibly into the other form (NLG).

The area of Natural Language Processing is divided into sub-areas, i.e., Natural Language Generation and Natural Language Understanding which are as the name suggests associated with the generation and understanding the message (text or speech).

### **Natural Language Understanding**

- NLU is an artificial intelligence language that uses computer software to recognize text or speech sentences.
- The NLU provides a direct human-computer interaction. The NLU allows human languages to be understood statically by the computer without the use of if / else.
- Goal is to derive meaning from natural language.
- Imagine a Concept (aka Semantic or Representation) space
- In it, an idea/word/concept has a unique computer representation
- Usually via a vector space
- NLU Mapping language into this space

**NLU Applications:**

- ML on Text (Classification, Regression, Clustering)
- Document Recommendation
- Language Identification
- Natural Language Search
- Sentiment Analysis
- Text Summarization
- Extracting Word/Document Meaning (vectors)
- Relationship Extraction
- Topic Modelling

### **Natural Language Generation (NLG) **

- Natural-language generation (NLG) is a software process that transforms structured data into natural language (or written narrative).
- Mapping from computer representation space to language space
- Opposite direction of NLU
- Usually need NLU to perform NLG!

**NLG Applications:**

- Image Captioning
- (Better) Text Summarization
- Machine Translation
- Question Answering (QA)/Chatbots
