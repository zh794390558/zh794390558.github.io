# TensorRT

The core of TensorRTâ„¢ is a C++ library that facilitates high performance inference on NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). 
It is designed to work in a complementary fashion with training frameworks such as TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, MXNet, etc. 
It focuses specifically on running an already trained network quickly and efficiently on a GPU for the purpose of generating a result (a process that is referred to in various places as scoring, detecting, regression, or inference).

## [Working With TensorFlow](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/tensorrt-developer-guide/index.html#working_tf)

TensorFlow integration with TensorRT(TF-TRT) optimizes and executes compatible subgraphs, allowing TensorFlow to execute the remaining graph. While you can still use TensorFlow's wide and flexible feature set, TensorRT will parse the model and apply optimizations to the portions of the graph wherever possible.  

You will need to create a SavedModel (or frozen graph) out of a trained TensorFlow model, and give that to the Python API of TF-TRT, which then:
* returns the TensorRT optimized SavedModel (or frozen graph).
* replaces each supported subgraph with a TensorRT optimized node (called TRTEngineOp), producing a new TensorFlow graph.

During the TF-TRT optimization, TensorRT performs several important transformations and optimizations to the neural network graph. First, layers with unused output are eliminated to avoid unnecessary computation. Next, where possible, certain layers (such as convolution, bias, and ReLU) are fused to form a single layer. Another transformation is horizontal layer fusion, or layer aggregation, along with the required division of aggregated layers to their respective output. Horizontal layer fusion improves performance by combining layers that take the same source tensor and apply the same operations with similar parameters.
